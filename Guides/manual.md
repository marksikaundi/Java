### 🎯 Goal:

Build real-world projects, understand Java development tools and frameworks.

### ✅ Topics to Cover:

* Introduction to Maven or Gradle
* Build Tools & Dependency Management
* JavaFX (for GUI) or basic Spring Boot (for backend)
* Working with APIs (JSON, RESTful APIs)
* Databases (JDBC + MySQL or PostgreSQL)

### 🛠️ Final Project Ideas:

## 🧠 Tips for Success:

* Practice daily — even 1 hour consistently matters more than sporadic long sessions.
* Write code, not just read or watch.
* Join Java communities (Reddit, StackOverflow, Discord)
* Work on GitHub portfolios.
